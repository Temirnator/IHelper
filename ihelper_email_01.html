<p>Dear <?= tutor.fullname ?> ,</p>

<p>Welcome to the IHelper Project! We are so excited for you to join us. Your willingness to help other people and open-heartedness make you the perfect fit for the <b>tutoring position.</b></p>

<p><b>I am <?= tutor.username ?>,</b> and I will be <b>your <?= tutor.userposition ?>.</b> Feel free to reach out to me with <b>any questions during the onboarding process.</b></p>


<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>As you may know, IHelper is an educational project that aims to raise the quality of education of children from socially vulnerable categories (SVC) and raise the awareness of Nazarbayev University (NU) students about the importance and responsibilities regarding education and social problems. It aims to connect the children who want to get help with their studies and those students who desire to help them by sharing their knowledge and experience. </p>

<p>We, as an organisational team, need to help tutors to meet high standards of tutoring and control the process of free social tutoring. Our coordinators are expected to have a significant amount of responsibility and readiness to dedicate their time to children and tutors of the IHelper project. We believe that our project will help to reduce educational inequality and positively influence the inclusion in the society.</p>

<h3>Format of Lessons</h3>
<p>Tutors of the IHelper project are supposed to teach Mathematics and English* for kids from socially vulnerable categories for 2 hours a week for 11 weeks** (22 hours in total). Each month, or 4 weeks to be exact, tutors need to prepare detailed feedback on the kids they are tutoring. This will allow us to track how effectively kids are being taught.
</p>

<p>After successful completion of 22 hours of teaching tutors receive a certificate of participation in the project. If tutors demonstrate an outstanding performance in teaching kids, which we can track either by feedback from parents and their kids or by presenting academic achievements of students that were achieved as a result of effective tutoring, tutors are going to receive a special Tutors Awards Certificate.
</p>

<p>Finally, be supportive and caring, and make sure to be in good relationships with your kid, his/her parents, your coordinator, and stay updated with the messages from us.</p>

<p>
<br>* - Maths and English are preferred but not compulsory, you can agree with your student/parents to study other subjects.
<br>** - We understand that university students usually have a very tight schedule and thatâ€™s why we allow them to have 3 weeks in the period that are free from any lessons for midterm/final exams/exam preparation or other important university deadlines but they have to conduct these postponed lessons later to meet the 22-hour requirement.
