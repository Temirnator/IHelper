  <li>Student Feedback Submission: <b>Every 4 Weeks**, Sunday 23:59;</b></li>
</ol>
<br>* - We understand that university students usually have a very tight schedule and thatâ€™s why we allow them to have 3 weeks in the period that are free from any lessons for midterm/final exams/exam preparation or other important university deadlines but they have to conduct these postponed lessons later to meet the 22-hour requirement.
<br>** - That is, lessons 1, 6, and 11 are used for assessing performance of your student.
